# BookForge v2 — Merged Architecture (draft — not frozen)

> **One line:** Event-sourced canon, gated by validate-before-apply, fed by a swappable
> persistent-memory tier (Headroom as reference), driven through an agent-agnostic `bf` CLI,
> orchestrated by a model-routing harness (OpenCode as reference) that sends cheap models at
> extraction and strong models at prose. One engine, layered vocabularies, no tool lock-in.

This supersedes both prior drafts (`REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` folds into M0 + M3). Two layers were
missing in earlier drafts and are now first-class: the **Persistent Memory Tier** (Headroom
et al.) and the **Harness / Model-Routing Layer** (OpenCode et al.). Model routing is encoded
in the repo, not assumed.

> **Status — not frozen.** This is the current merged draft, not a frozen architecture. The
> command-surface fixes from review (canon/memory split, proposal-based learning) are applied
> below. The load-bearing unknown is **fold-engine feasibility for narrative state** (see §13)
> — prototype that on a real book's `continuity-out.md` chain before treating this as final.

> **Execution order — where `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` fits.** `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` is **not** a separate
> predecessor. It is the foundation slice of this plan — every phase of it is absorbed into a
> v2 milestone (full mapping in Appendix B). Execute it *as* M0, not as a standalone project:
>
> ```
> M0   = REPO_FIX_PLAN Phase 0, 1, 7   ← do FIRST (hygiene, defaults, golden tests)
> M1   = REPO_FIX_PLAN Phase 3         ← decouple (entry surface, AGENTS.md → bf)
> M2   = NEW v2 work                   ← event-sourced canon
> M2.5 = NEW v2 work                   ← persistent memory tier
> M3   = REPO_FIX_PLAN Phase 2, 4, 5, 6 ← cleanup (exceptions, validator, adapters)
> M4, M5
> ```
>
> Golden tests must be captured in M0 **before** the M2/M3 refactor — that is the one hard
> sequencing constraint. See Appendix B for the phase-by-phase mapping.

## 1. The Five-Layer Architecture

```
LAYER 5 — AGENT HARNESS (OpenCode as reference; Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Copilot / Zed)
  ├─ model routing: small_model → extraction/alias/continuity; strong model → prose only
  ├─ subagents + MCP connections
  └─ reads AGENTS.md + a generated per-agent instruction file
        │ calls
        ▼
LAYER 4 — bf CLI (the agent-agnostic contract; any agent can drive it)
        │ uses
        ▼
LAYER 3 — PERSISTENT MEMORY TIER
  ├─ MemoryBackend Protocol: retrieve(query) / learn(failed_session) / stats()
  ├─ HeadroomBackend (reference) — usable as Python library OR as MCP server
  ├─ LocalEmbeddingBackend (zero-dep fallback)
  ├─ VectorDBBackend (future)
  └─ two exposure modes:
       bf memory search/resolve/learn  (default, agent-agnostic)
       bf memory serve --mcp           (opt-in, for agents that prefer agent-driven calls)
        │ reads/writes (semantic retrieval over canon + drafts + accumulated history)
        ▼
LAYER 2 — THE GATE (OpenSpec invariant; non-negotiable)
  bf validate MUST pass → bf apply is the ONLY canon mutation path
        │ protects
        ▼
LAYER 1 — CANON TIER (event-sourced)
  entities (static defs) + events (append-only) + fold(snapshot, derived/rebuildable)
```

**Hard rules:** Layer 2 is non-negotiable (no drift). Layer 3 never *is* canon — it retrieves
and compresses *around* it. Layer 5 is swappable (no lock-in to OpenCode or any one harness).

**First principle — compressed context is not truth.** Compression (Headroom, local regex,
any retriever) may reduce what a model *reads*, but it never replaces canonical files, approved
artifacts, review decisions, or validator source material. Canon is the only truth; everything
above Layer 1 is a view onto it. This single rule protects canon from silent drift through
lossy memory layers, and it is the reason Layer 3 is forbidden from mutating canon directly.

---

## 2. Why the Merge Works

### 2.1 Four vocabularies, one engine (git-flow / event-sourcing / save-state / OpenSpec)

| Concept | git-flow | event sourcing | save-state | OpenSpec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical state | main branch | aggregate state | save file | specs/ |
| Unit of change | feature branch | event | checkpoint | change |
| Validation | CI on PR | validate-on-apply | load+check | openspec validate |
| Promote | merge | append event | save | openspec apply |

All four are the same machine. Exposed as Layer-4 CLI aliases so writers, collaborators,
architects, and agents each get their vocabulary.

### 2.2 Three memory options, one subsystem

| Want | First-class tier | Headroom MCP | Pluggable adapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent-agnostic (no MCP dependency) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Reuse Headroom's existing MCP | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ only if it's a backend |
| Swappable / no tool privileged | ⚠️ Headroom privileged | ❌ Headroom-only | ✅ |
| Works even when agent doesn't speak MCP | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Merge:** one `MemoryBackend` Protocol; Headroom is the reference backend exposed both as a
library (via `bf memory`) and optionally as an MCP server (`bf memory serve --mcp`); cheap
models do extraction via the harness.

### 2.3 Continuity lock levels (the gate is not binary)

Adapted from `docs/BOOKFORGE-MASTER-PLAN.md` §9. A binary validate-passes-or-fails gate can't
distinguish "Tex is dead in ch6 but speaking in ch9" (a hard contradiction) from "Mara's mood
shifted without clear cause" (a soft signal). Fiction continuity is graded. The gate therefore
uses **three lock levels** — and these map directly onto the `Severity` enum that already exists
in `bookforge/core/issue.py` (`Severity.HARD / SOFT / INFO`) but is not yet used this way.

| Lock level | Maps to | Behavior | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strict** | `Severity.HARD` | Blocks `bf apply`. Canon mutation impossible until an explicit approved event resolves it. | Character identity, alias → entity, ammo count, death, destroyed object, ownership |
| **Guarded** | `Severity.SOFT` | Requires evidence/transition logic to change; `bf apply` proceeds but emits a reviewable warning. | Injuries, relationships, supplies, motivations, social standing, knowledge state |
| **Soft** | `Severity.INFO` | Consistency preferred; a drift produces a review signal, not a block. | Mood, replaceable clothing, incidental descriptive detail |

**Why this matters:** the "dead character being treated in chapter 9" post-mortem
(`outline_feedback_analysis.md`) is a *Strict* violation. "Mara seems angry without setup" is a
*Soft* signal. The current binary gate treats both the same; the lock levels let the gate
respond proportionally. Implementation cost is low — `Severity` already exists, the enum is
already in `loop.classify`; we just need validators to emit the right level per rule and the
gate to respect `INFO` (pass), `SOFT` (pass+warn), `HARD` (block).

**Default lockable domains** (from the master plan, §9): character names + aliases, animal
identities, weapons + ammunition, injuries/health, money, supplies, inventory, locations,
travel state, timeline, motivations, relationships, personality baselines, secrets, knowledge
boundaries, objects, documents, promises, setup/payoff threads. A lock changes only through an
approved `StateTransition` (an event), a canon change, or a scoped override with reason+audit.

---

## 3. Model Routing (the "strong models only for prose" goal, encoded)

The harness (OpenCode et al.) does the routing, but BookForge *declares* the intent so it's
agent-agnostic and reproducible.

```yaml
# spec/model-routing.yml (or persona-registry.json, migrated)
personas:
  extractor:                 # cheap/local — memory extraction, alias resolution, summaries
    model_class: cheap
    examples: [gemini-flash, gpt-4o-mini, local-7b]
    tasks: [memory_build, resolve_alias, summarize_continuity, classify_beats]
  reviewer:                  # mid — validation review, style flags
    model_class: mid
    examples: [gpt-4o, claude-haiku]
    tasks: [validate_review, style_scan_semantic]
  writer:                    # strong — PROSE ONLY
    model_class: strong
    examples: [claude-sonnet, gpt-4o, opus]
    tasks: [draft_prose]
```

- `AGENTS.md` references this; `bf init --agents opencode` emits an OpenCode config that maps
  `small_model` → extractor, default model → writer; `bf init --agents claude` emits a subagent
  definition; `bf init --agents codex` emits a task-type hint file.
- `bf check-persona --persona writer` (already in `persona.py`) enforces this registry.

**Layer 5 is optional.** The model-routing tier is a cost optimization, not a requirement.
BookForge fully works without OpenCode or any routing-capable harness. Any agent that can read
files and run shell commands — Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot CLI, ZCode,
Zed, or equivalent — can drive the full cycle by reading `AGENTS.md` and calling `bf`.

Without a routing harness, the workflow still functions, but one model handles all
model-assisted tasks. The only lost optimization is automatic task routing: extraction, alias
resolution, and summaries no longer go to a cheap model automatically, while prose no longer
routes separately to a stronger model. The architecture remains valid because `bf` is the
contract; model routing is only an efficiency layer.

```
Minimum viable agent layer:   Any shell-capable agent + AGENTS.md + bf
Optimized agent layer:        OpenCode or equivalent harness + model routing
Core product:                 BookForge CLI + canon + validation + memory
```

---

## 4. Canon Model (Layer 1 — event-sourced)

### 4.1 The durable-vs-current boundary (the key correction)

Canon is split by **what changes** — not just by file type. This is the single most important
correction in this plan, lifted from `docs/BOOKFORGE-MASTER-PLAN.md` §7/§9.

- **Durable identity (CanonCore):** who a character *is* — name, role, physical marker, voice,
  arc constraints, POV rules. Does NOT change per chapter. Lives in `canon/entities/`.
- **Current state (story-state / MemoryVault):** where they *are now* — location, injuries,
  inventory, emotional condition, relationship status, knowledge state. Changes every chapter.
  Lives in the event fold (`canon/state/snapshot.yml`), rebuilt from `canon/events/`.

The earlier draft of this plan muddled the boundary by putting `world-state.yml` (current
location/injuries/inventory — *current* state by definition) under `canon/entities/`. That was
wrong. Canon holds durable identity only; the per-chapter mutations belong in the event fold.

```
DURABLE (canon/entities/, rarely changes)        CURRENT (canon/state/snapshot.yml, fold output)
─────────────────────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
characters.yml  → name, role, physical marker,   (current location, injuries, inventory,
                  voice, POV, tier, arc          emotional state — derived from events)
locations.yml   → place + function               (current occupancy — derived)
objects.yml     → durable profile (capacity,     (current holder, count, condition — derived)
                  type, constraints)
```

### 4.2 On-disk layout

```
books/<book-slug>/
  canon/
    entities/                      # DURABLE — does not change per chapter
      characters.yml               # canonical name, role, physical marker, voice, POV, tier
      aliases.yml                  # alias -> entity (Tex -> tex_cade)
      locations.yml                # places + function (choke point, dead drop)
      objects.yml                  # durable profiles: MacGuffins/gear (capacity, type, rules)
    events/                        # APPEND-ONLY — Layer 1 (the change log)
      chapter-01.event.yml         # structured continuity-out (status/location/inventory mutations)
      chapter-02.event.yml
    state/
      snapshot.yml                 # DERIVED fold = entities + all events (current truth; rebuildable)
  spec/
    premise.md  guardrails.md  tone.md  chapters.yml  model-routing.yml
  changes/
    chapter-NN/  proposal.md  beats.md  draft.md  continuity-out.md  packet.md
  state/  loop.json  analytics.json
  research-pack.md
```

`continuity-out.md` → event mapping:

| continuity-out section | Event mutation (→ folds into snapshot.yml) |
|---|---|
| Characters (alive/injured/absent) | status mutations |
| Changes (possessions/injuries/secrets/alliances/resources) | inventory/relationship/secret mutations |
| Locations (where key characters end) | location mutations |
| Human Stakes Carried / Unresolved Pressure | carried-forward state (part of the fold) |
| Next Chapter Must Know | invariants the next event must not violate |

`bf canon build` folds entities+events into `snapshot.yml` (lossless rebuild — delete it,
regenerate from events). This is the OpenSpec invariant made literal: source of truth is only
ever reached by replaying validated events.

### 4.3 Character tiers (not every character needs a full profile)

Adapted from `docs/BOOKFORGE-MASTER-PLAN.md` §7. A flat `characters.yml` over-profiles
incidental people and under-profiles protagonists. Use tiers with minimum-detail-per-tier:

| Tier | Use | Minimum fields |
|---|---|---|
| **Main** | Protagonists, antagonists, major POV | Full: identity, appearance, personality, motivations, voice, arc, relationships, forbidden changes |
| **Major supporting** | Recurring allies, rivals, family, mentors | Identity, role, distinguishing traits, voice guidance, relationships, continuity constraints |
| **Recurring side** | Recurring officials, workers, informants | Medium: purpose, traits, voice, relationships, pressure behavior |
| **Minor named** | Plot-relevant witness, courier, deputy | Lightweight: identity, purpose, role, voice summary, continuity notes |
| **Incidental** | One-scene background people, no continuity effect | Descriptor only (`the older woman behind the desk`); no profile |

**Governance rules** (also from the master plan):
- A proper-named character requires a stable `character_id` + at least a proposed profile
  *before* the name may appear in an approved artifact.
- Promotion (incidental → minor named → recurring side) requires a `CharacterPromotionRequest`
  citing why the person now matters; preserves descriptor lineage; doesn't silently rewrite prose.
- A model cannot approve, promote, or expand its own naming allowance — only `bf apply` after
  human review can.

### 4.4 Entity memory example (~200–500 tokens per packet)

```yaml
# canon/entities/characters.yml — DURABLE identity only
characters:
  tex_cade:
    canonical: "Tex Cade"
    tier: main
    role: protagonist
    physical_marker: "scar on left hand"
    voice: "clipped, few words, Texas plain"
    pov: allowed
    first_seen: chapter-01
  mara_vale:
    canonical: "Mara Vale"
    tier: major_supporting
    role: ally
    physical_marker: "red bandana, braided hair"
    voice: "formal, educated"
    pov: disallowed
    first_seen: chapter-02
  # Incidental characters never appear here — they stay as descriptors in the draft.

# canon/entities/aliases.yml
aliases:
  tex: tex_cade
  cade: tex_cade
  "mr. cade": tex_cade
  miss vale: mara_vale
  mara: mara_vale
```

Current state (location, injuries, inventory) is **never** in `characters.yml` — it lives in
the fold output `canon/state/snapshot.yml`, updated by applying chapter events.

---

## 5. CLI Surface (Layers 2/3/4 — one engine, aliased vocabularies)

```
# Gate (Layer 2 — non-negotiable)
bf validate [<book>] [--chapter N] [--review-prompt]
bf apply change <book> <chapter-id>          # append event + re-fold, only if validate passes

# Writer verbs (Layer 4 aliases over the gate)
bf checkpoint save|load|diff|restore

# Canon fold (Layer 1 — deterministic state; never touches the memory tier)
bf canon build <book>                        # re-fold entities + events into canon/state/snapshot.yml
bf canon validate <book>                     # validate entities, events, snapshot coherence

# Persistent memory (Layer 3 — semantic/retrieval; NEVER is canon)
bf memory build <book>                       # build/refresh semantic index over canon + drafts + history
bf memory search <book> "<query>"            # semantic retrieval (Headroom retrieve / local embedding)
bf memory resolve <book> "<name>"            # alias -> canonical entity
bf memory learn <book> <failed-session>      # produce a learning PROPOSAL; does NOT mutate AGENTS.md
bf memory apply-learning <book> <proposal-id>  # validate + promote approved rule into AGENTS.md / spec/
bf memory serve --mcp [--transport stdio|http]  # expose active backend as MCP tools (opt-in)
bf memory stats [<book>]

# Inspection / loop / compile
bf status  bf packet render|compress  bf loop  bf compile

# Setup / adapters / config
bf init <book> [--from <prior>] [--agents opencode,claude,codex,cursor,zed] [--git]
bf migrate <book>
bf adapter list                              # compression + research + memory backends
bf config show|set|get                       # selects active backends + routing
bf check-persona --persona <p> --action <a>  # enforce model-routing.yml
```

---

## 6. Agent Integration (Layer 5 — harness-aware, not harness-locked)

- **Primary:** `AGENTS.md` — agent-neutral, references `bf` + canon + model-routing.
- **Per-agent shims** (generated by `bf init --agents ...`): `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`,
  `copilot-instructions.md`, `GEMINI.md`, **and an OpenCode config** that wires `small_model`
  → extractor persona. Each is a thin importer of `AGENTS.md` plus a tool-specific note.
- OpenCode is *privileged as the reference harness* (because of its model routing) but **not
  required** — any file-reading agent works. No Codex/Antigravity/Gemini/OpenCode names
  hardcoded in the engine or canonical docs.
- Western-subgenre skills (Claude-Code `SKILL.md` convention with `compatibility`/
  `allowed-tools` frontmatter) move to agent-neutral markdown under `spec/` or `references/`.

---

## 7. Adapter Interfaces (Layers 3 + compression/research)

```python
# Layer 3 — Persistent Memory
class MemoryBackend(Protocol):
    def retrieve(self, query: str) -> list[Chunk]: ...
    def learn(self, failed_session) -> list[Rule]: ...
    def stats(self) -> MemoryStats: ...

class HeadroomMemoryBackend: ...      # reference; uses headroom retrieve/stats/learn + SharedContext
class LocalEmbeddingBackend: ...      # zero-dep fallback
class VectorDBBackend: ...            # future

# Compression (packet/context)
class CompressionBackend(Protocol):
    def compress(self, text: str) -> str: ...

class LocalRegexBackend: ...
class HeadroomBackend: ...

# Research
class ResearchBackend(Protocol):
    def query(self, q: str) -> str: ...
    def ingest(self, src) -> None: ...

class ManualBackend: ...
class NotebookLMBackend: ...
```

Engine core depends only on Protocols. `bf config` selects backends. `notebooklm.py`
(573 lines, 12 bare excepts) shrinks to one adapter.

---

## 8. Three-Layer Memory (target, expanded)

```
Agent Harness (OpenCode/Claude/Codex/Cursor/Copilot/Zed)  = workflow memory (ephemeral)
   |  reads AGENTS.md + model-routing, calls bf
   v
bf CLI (agent-agnostic contract)
   |
   ├─► Persistent Memory Tier (Headroom / local embedding) = working/semantic memory
   |     (retrieves & compresses AROUND canon; never is canon; cross-session; learns)
   |
   └─► Canon Tier (event-sourced entities + events + fold) = CANON memory (authoritative)
```

Canon never lives only in Headroom's embedded chunks. Headroom compresses/retrieves *around*
the canon files.

---

## 9. Milestones (re-phased; M2.5 is NEW for the memory tier)

> **Status legend:** `- [x]` done · `- [ ]` not started · `- [~]` deferred · `⚠️` blocked.
> Last updated post-M1 partial (commits `3ee86ba`, `f56c27f`, `47c6990`).

### M0 — Foundation & Hygiene (~3 days, zero-risk) — ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Remove root scratch files (`compile_helper.py`, `scratch_*.py`)
- [x] Un-ignore `tests/` and `docs/` in `.gitignore`
- [x] Fix `tex-cade` → `book-example` defaults (22 files → 23 occurrences across 11 .py files)
- [x] `bf` no-arg → `status` (Windows-safe; demote TUI to `bf tui`)
- [x] Capture golden-file tests for current loop/validator output (regression net) — `tests/golden/`
- [x] **Bonus:** installed `pytest` + `pyyaml` (3 tests were failing on missing `yaml` import)
- **Shippable:** cleaner repo, works on Windows, tests tracked. **Verified:** 109/109 tests pass; golden output identical post-M1.

### M1 — Decouple from Agents + Model Routing Skeleton (~5 days, parallel with M2) — 🟡 PARTIAL
- [x] Strip Codex/Antigravity/Gemini names from `AGENTS.md`, `docs/workflow-v5.md`, all
      `SKILL.md` files, `loop.py`/`cli.py` help text
- [ ] Establish `AGENTS.md` as primary; build `bf init --agents` to generate `CLAUDE.md` /
      `.cursor/rules` / `copilot-instructions.md` / `GEMINI.md` / **OpenCode config**
- [ ] **Define `spec/model-routing.yml`** (extractor/reviewer/writer personas); wire
      `bf check-persona` to enforce it; have `bf init --agents opencode` emit `small_model` mapping
- [~] ~~Convert 13 shim scripts to `bf` aliases or remove; rewrite `AGENTS.md` to `bf`~~
      **Deferred to M5.** Shims still work (they delegate to `bookforge.core` via `from X import *`);
      deleting them now would break every documented command in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
      Full removal at M5 once docs are migrated to `bf` CLI as primary.
- [x] Remove `.agents/skills/*/agents/openai.yaml`; consolidate skill content into agent-neutral md
- [x] Demote TUI (carried from M0 if not done): `bf tui` opt-in (done in M0.4 — no-arg → `status`)
- **Shippable:** any agent drives the system; model-routing intent declared in-repo.
- **Status:** 3 of 5 active bullets done. Remaining 2 (`bf init --agents` + `spec/model-routing.yml`) are the model-routing skeleton.

### M2 — Event-Sourced Canon Core (Layers 1+2, ~6-8 days, parallel with M2.5/M3) — ⏳ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Define `canon/entities/*.yml` schemas (characters, aliases, locations, objects) + validation
- [ ] Define `canon/events/chapter-NN.event.yml` schema (structured continuity-out → event)
- [ ] Build the **fold engine**: `bf canon build` re-derives `canon/state/snapshot.yml` from
      entities + events (canon fold is Layer 1, NOT the memory tier)
- [ ] Build canon validators: alias resolution, timeline ordering, cross-event consistency (the
      "no dead character acting" check), entity-vs-event coherence
- [ ] Build `bf migrate` (old rulebook/world-state/relationships/continuity-out → entities +
      events, lossless, idempotent)
- [ ] **Build the gate (Layer 2):** `bf apply change` as the ONLY canon mutation path;
      `bf validate` must pass before append
- [ ] Separate `loop-state.json` into pure controller state (`state/loop.json`) — remove
      NotebookLM coupling
- ⚠️ **Load-bearing unknown (blocks freeze):** prototype the fold on a real `continuity-out.md`
      chain before committing — narrative state is graded/decaying, not discrete. See §13.
- **Shippable:** event-sourced canon with protected source of truth; entity lookup works;
      rollback is a fold replay.

### M2.5 — Persistent Memory Tier (Layer 3, ~4-5 days, parallel with M3) — ⏳ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Define `MemoryBackend` Protocol (retrieve/learn/stats)
- [ ] `HeadroomMemoryBackend`: wraps `headroom.compress`/`retrieve`/`stats` + `headroom learn` +
      `SharedContext`; usable as library via `bf memory *`
- [ ] `LocalEmbeddingBackend`: zero-dep fallback (TF-IDF / keyword index over canon+drafts+history)
- [ ] `bf memory build/search/resolve/learn/apply-learning/stats`, where `learn` creates a
      proposal and `apply-learning` validates + promotes approved rules into `AGENTS.md` / `spec/`
- [ ] `bf memory serve --mcp`: expose the active backend as MCP tools (headroom_compress/
      retrieve/stats) for agents that prefer agent-driven calls — **opt-in, not required**
- [ ] `bf memory learn` produces proposals only; only `bf memory apply-learning` (after
      validation) mutates `AGENTS.md` / `spec/` — `learn` never writes the contract directly
- **Shippable:** persistent cross-session semantic memory; Headroom first-class but swappable;
      agent-agnostic by default, MCP-optional.

### M3 — CLI Vocabularies + Adapters + Cleanup (Layer 4 + compression/research, ~6-8 days, parallel) — ⏳ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Implement Layer 4 writer verbs as aliases over the gate: `bf checkpoint save/load/diff`,
      `bf restore`
- [ ] Implement Layer 4 opt-in: git-tracking guidance, `bf init --git` for branch-per-chapter
      workflow
- [ ] Reorganize `bf` subcommands per §5
- [ ] Implement adapter Protocols; move `headroom.py` and `notebooklm.py` behind
      `adapters/compression.py` and `adapters/research.py`
- [ ] Rewrite context-packet renderer to pull from `canon/` (fallback to old `rulebook.md`)
- [ ] Fix the 45 bare `except Exception` sites (specific exceptions + logging) — correctness-critical
- [ ] Fix `FORBIDDEN_LENGTH_LANGUAGE` `"words"` false-positive (restrict to planning artifacts)
- [ ] Finish `ManuscriptIssue` type migration in `loop.classify` (remove `list[object]` duck-typing)
- [ ] Decompose `validator.py` (1,505 lines) into focused submodules behind a facade
- [ ] Shim removal (carried from M1.6): delete the 13 `.agents/skills/.../scripts/*.py` shims
      once `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` are migrated to `bf` CLI as primary
- **Shippable:** clean CLI, multi-vocabulary, adapter-pluggable, trustworthy validation.

### M4 — Full Change Workflow (~3-4 days, on top of M2+M2.5+M3) — ⏳ NOT STARTED
- [ ] `changes/chapter-NN/proposal.md` + `beats.md` as the authoring unit
- [ ] `bf apply change <book> <id>` promotes: validate → append event → re-fold → compile draft →
      archive change
- [ ] `bf validate --chapter N` enforces chapter-vs-spec before apply (the OpenSpec
      "validate before merge")
- [ ] `bf apply` refuses if validation fails — the deterministic gate made visible
- **Shippable:** chapter work follows proposal→validate→apply discipline; canon stays clean.

### M5 — Polish, Docs, Deprecation (~2-3 days) — ⏳ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Comprehensive `AGENTS.md` rewrite (agent-neutral, `bf`-based, references 5-layer model)
- [ ] Per-agent instruction generation finalized (incl. OpenCode `small_model` config)
- [ ] Deprecation warnings on old paths (`rulebook.md` direct edits, old script paths), then removal
- [ ] Full test suite: canon validators, fold engine, memory backends, adapters, golden files
- [ ] Cross-platform `scripts/install.py` (replaces bash-only `install.sh`)
- **Shippable:** documented, tested, portable, ready for any harness.

### Suggested timeline (M1 / M2 / M2.5 / M3 overlap per the parallel priority)

```
Week 1:   M0 (foundation + golden tests)
Week 1-2: M1 (decouple + model-routing skeleton)
Week 2-3: M2 (event-sourced canon)  ┐
          M2.5 (persistent memory)  ├ parallel
          M3 (CLI + adapters)       ┘
Week 3:   merge + M4 (change workflow)
Week 4:   M5 (polish/docs/deprecation)
```

## 11. Acceptance Criteria — "v2 done" means

- [ ] Any agentic single-model agent — Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot
      CLI, ZCode, Zed, or equivalent — can drive a full book cycle by reading only `AGENTS.md`
      and calling `bf`; **no routing harness is required.**
- [ ] *Optional optimization:* with OpenCode or any `small_model`-capable harness,
      `bf init --agents opencode` wires extraction, alias resolution, summaries, and continuity
      scanning to a cheap model while prose tasks route to a stronger model.
- [ ] Persistent memory tier exists: `bf memory search` returns semantic hits across canon +
      drafts + history; `bf memory serve --mcp` exposes it as MCP tools (opt-in)
- [ ] Headroom is the reference memory backend but swappable via `bf config` with zero
      engine-code changes
- [ ] `bf memory learn` produces proposals only; only `bf memory apply-learning` (after
      validation) mutates `AGENTS.md` — `learn` never writes the contract directly
- [ ] Canon is event-sourced: snapshot = fold of validated events; delete + rebuild losslessly
- [ ] `bf apply` is the only canon mutation path; `bf validate` is the non-negotiable gate
- [ ] `bf checkpoint save/load/diff` give writer-native verbs over the same engine
- [ ] `bf memory resolve "Tex"` returns canonical entity + aliases in <500 tokens
- [ ] No Codex/Antigravity/Gemini/OpenCode names hardcoded in engine or canonical docs
- [ ] `bf` works on Windows out of the box (no-arg = status, no termios crash)
- [ ] No bare `except Exception` in `bookforge/core/` outside adapter subprocess code
- [ ] Old workflow works during migration with deprecation warnings
- [ ] Tests + golden files tracked in git; `tests/` and `docs/` version-controlled

## 12. Migration Strategy (Non-Breaking)

1. New `canon/` structure **coexists** with old `rulebook.md` / `world-state.json` /
   `relationships.json` during migration.
2. `bf migrate <book>` reads old files and emits `canon/*.yml` + `events/*.event.yml`
   (lossless, idempotent).
3. Old files remain as fallback until a `bf config set canon.v2 native` flag flip.
4. Context packet renderer learns to read from `canon/` first, falls back to old `rulebook.md`.
5. Each milestone ships working; no big-bang rewrite.

---

## 13. Open Questions (resolve before the relevant milestone)

**Load-bearing — blocks architecture freeze:**

- **Fold-engine feasibility for narrative state.** The fold model assumes events compose
  cleanly. Fiction state is fuzzier: "Mara is injured" — how injured, when does it heal, does
  it still hold in chapter 9? Software events are discrete; story state is graded and decays.
  Before freezing, prototype the fold on a real book's `continuity-out.md` chain and confirm
  narrative mutations compose without contradiction. If they don't, the fold model needs an
  explicit reconciliation/conflict-resolution step, not just append+reduce. This is the one
  question the command-surface fixes do NOT answer.

**Other — resolvable per-milestone:**

1. **Sample book name:** keep `book-example`, or restore `tex-cade` as the real sample?
2. **Event granularity:** one event per chapter (coarse, matches `continuity-out.md`), or
   one event per scene/beat (fine-grained, more rollback fidelity but more overhead)?
3. **Memory backend default:** Headroom (if installed) or LocalEmbedding? *Recommendation:
   LocalEmbedding default, Headroom when `bf config set memory.backend headroom`.*
4. **MCP exposure default-off?** *Recommendation: yes — `bf memory serve --mcp` is opt-in.*
5. **Routing enforcement:** advisory (`AGENTS.md` tells the harness) or hard (`bf` refuses to
   run writer tasks unless invoked by a strong-model persona)? *Recommendation: advisory first,
   hard enforcement as an M5 option.*

## 14. What Was Wrong With Earlier Drafts (for the record)

- **Draft 1 (OpenSpec transposition):** One metaphor. Too rigid for creative discovery; specs
  are stable but canon churns every chapter.
- **Draft 2 (merged four metaphors):** Better — recognized git-flow/event-sourcing/save-state/
  OpenSpec are one machine with different vocabularies. But **dropped Headroom as a first-class
  tier** (reduced it to "one compression adapter") and **had no persistent-memory subsystem**.
  Also dropped model routing.
- **This draft (final):** Adds Layer 3 (Persistent Memory Tier — Headroom as reference, MCP
  exposure opt-in) and Layer 5 (Harness / Model Routing — OpenCode as reference, small_model
  → extraction, strong model → prose). Both were in your original vision and got flattened in
  earlier drafts.

## Appendix A — Sources That Shaped This Plan

- **OpenSpec** (Fission-AI/OpenSpec) — files-as-contract + deterministic CLI +
  validate-before-apply + `init` adapts per-agent
- **Headroom** (chopratejas/headroom) — library/proxy/MCP compression + `retrieve`/`stats`/
  `learn` + `SharedContext` cross-agent memory + `headroom wrap` for claude/codex/cursor/
  aider/copilot
- **NotebookLM MCP CLI** (jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli) — the "one MCP server, N thin agent
  skill folders" packaging pattern
- **AGENTS.md ecosystem** — the converging agent-instruction standard (Codex, Claude Code,
  Gemini CLI all read it)

## Appendix B — Relationship to `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md`

`REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` (the earlier hygiene/correctness plan) is **not deleted** — it remains the
detailed reference for M0 and parts of M3:

- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 0 (hygiene) → BookForge v2 **M0**
- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 1 (stale defaults, Windows-safe `bf`) → BookForge v2 **M0**
- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 2 (exception swallowing, length-language false-positive) → **M3**
- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 3 (entry surface, `AGENTS.md` → `bf`) → **M1**
- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 4 (`ManuscriptIssue` migration) → **M3**
- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 5 (decompose `validator.py`) → **M3**
- `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` Phase 6 (cross-platform install, NotebookLM isolation) → **M3 + M5**

Everything in `REPO_FIX_PLAN.md` is absorbed into this plan.
